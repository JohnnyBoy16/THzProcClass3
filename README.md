# THzProc Class in Python 3

## A class representation of THzData in Python 3. 

This is a class representation of THzData that allows for new more specialized programs to be easily
created by inhereting THzData. This class also allows new programs to use the data by simply instantiating
a THzData class.

Base interactivity in the form of an interactive C-Scan and A-Scan are provided as well. The grayscale
C-Scan can be clicked on to show the A-Scan waveform that generated that pixel. Also, the gates in the
A-Scan can be clicked on to adjust the C-Scan to a new time slice.
